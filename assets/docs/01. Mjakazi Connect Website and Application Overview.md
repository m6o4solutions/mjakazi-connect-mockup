## Overview

Mjakazi Connect Limited aims to build a digital platform that connects families with reliable caregivers and domestic staff. The goal is to make it easier for households to discover, evaluate, and engage caregivers, while giving job seekers a credible channel to present themselves and access opportunities.

The platform will function as both a public website and a restricted-access web application. It focuses on visibility, trust, and controlled access rather than managing the full employment lifecycle.
