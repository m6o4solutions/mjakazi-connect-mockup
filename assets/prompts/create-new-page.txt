I would like to create a new page named login.html and it should have the following attributes:
1. Have a header section with the title of "Log In" and a brief description of the page like the blogs page.
2. It should have the common header and footer from the homepage.
3. Update the @/vite.config.js with the details of this page in the same way as the directory.html page.
4. Initialize lucide icons on the login.html page.
5. All header links with the text "Log In" should be updated to point to the login.html page.
6. The main section should contain a 3 x 1 grid of cards with the following attributes
   i. The left card will have a placeholder for an image with the heading "Log In as Administrator". The body text will be a brief description of the choice. Finally the CTA button will be "Log In" (Green/Emerald).
   ii. The middle card will have a placeholder for an image with the heading "Log In as Family Member". The body text will be a brief description of the choice. Finally the CTA button will be "Log In" (Green/Emerald).
   iii. The right card will have a placeholder for an image with the heading "Log In as Domestic Contractor". The body text will be a brief description of the choice. Finally the CTA button will be "Log In" (Green/Emerald).
